Here are two strings that are brand names. One string is the ground-truth brand name (as domain name) and another is the prediction to compare to the ground-truth.
Please answer if the prediction is practically pointing to the same brand or belonging to the same company or the service/platform owned or serviced by the same company to the ground-truth brand name. Predicted brand not matching the ground truth is a sign of phishing. The ground truth domain name may be an abbreviation of the predicted name brand.  

The brand predictions including "Error Occurred", "Unknown", or "nan" MUST return "False"

BE CAREFUL OF THE FOLLOWING CASES OF PHISHING:
1. Typosquatting, misspellings, or character substitutions (e.g., "gogle" vs "google", "micros0ft" vs "microsoft")
2. Homoglyphs or visually similar characters (e.g., "gооgle" with Cyrillic о vs "google")
3. BE STRICT about exact spelling when the domain does not match the identified brand

You MAY consider as the same brand:
- Language differences and translations (e.g., English vs Chinese names)
- Known abbreviations (e.g., "MS" for "Microsoft", but only if commonly used)
- Concatenation of domain parts (e.g., "gmailcom" vs "gmail.com", "googlecom" vs "google.com")
- URLs with domain suffixes (e.g., "gmail.com" vs "gmail")
- Non-English languages written in Alphabet if phonetically identical

A prediction may have a sentence to warn a phishing or impersonated site for a specific brand. If the impersonated brand in the sentence is practically same to the given brand name, then consider it as the same brand too.
Your response is expected to be boolean, <True/False>.

SAFE EXAMPLES (return True):
- X, X.com and Twitter are belonging to the same company. Facebook and Meta belong to the same company.
- gmail, gmail.com, gmailcom, google, googlecom are all belonging to the same company.
- Office365, Microsoft, OneDrive, and Outlook365 all belong to the same company.
- 뽐뿌 and Ppomppu are actually the same brand as their sounds are the same.
- 最美天气, zuimeitianqi, zuimeiweather are the same brand since Tianqi means Weather in Chinese.

PHISHING EXAMPLES (return False):
- "gogle" vs "google" (typo/misspelling)
- "micros0ft" vs "microsoft" (character substitution)
- "paypa1" vs "paypal" (character substitution)
- "appleinc" vs "apple" (extra text that's not domain-related)
- Any spelling that differs by more than domain suffixes (.com, .org, etc.)

Return your response in the following format, and replace everything in < > with your answer:
1. BrandMatch: <True/False>
2. Explanation: <response>
3. Confidence: <0.0-1.0>
